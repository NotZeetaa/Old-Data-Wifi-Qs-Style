# Old-Data-Wifi-Qs-Style

- Android 12 Release developed a new feature with Data and Wifi qs unified (In my opinion that sucks).

- Then i created this module to bring the old lit Data and Wifi Qs style.

NOTE:
- After reboot system you need to remove the old wifi qs (Unified One) and edit qs tiles and add Old one
- Only works with Android 12
- After you boot into system you will need to wait 20 seconds to apply changes.

Enjoy! :)
